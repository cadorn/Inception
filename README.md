The `root` of my Original Source Logic for the Purpose of Seeding an *Open Source Web Software System Development Toolchain*.

> I am Binding a Software Ecosystem that uses Existing and Future Open Source Software as Reusable Components that are Declaratively Assembled into Systems.

The *Logic* contained and referenced within *forms* the Background and Foundation for all my Work.

**INTENDED USE:** The *Logic and Code contained within* forms a **Developer Tool** and is intended to operate as part of a *Web Software Development Toolchain* on which a *Production System* operates indirectly. It is **NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN HIGH-LOAD ENVIRONMENTS** as there is *little focus on Runtime Optimization* in order to *maximize API Utility, Compatibility and Flexibility*.

If you *need more* than what is contained within, study the Code, understand the Logic, and build your *Own Implementation* that is *API Compatible*. Share it with others who follow the same *Logic* and *API Contract* specified within. This Community of Users will likely want to use Your Work in their own *Software Development Toolchains*.
